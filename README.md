# Employee Tracker

## Description

The Employee Tracker application allows a user to review their employee structure through a CLI interface using a SQL database. Users can view employees, departmnets, and roles, as well as add employees, roles, depratments. They can also update an existing employee's role to one that is in the org structure. 

In developing this application I learned a lot about how to integrate SQL databases into applications and how to work on them with prepared statements in JavaScript.
